#### Objectives
- Probing menteesâ€™ existing notions of traits of successful and unsuccessful people that they know of and admire/criticize
- Developing a relative but holistic definition of success
- Developing parameters of success

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
- Chalks if carried out on the board
- Stationary if carried out on paper

#### How It Works
Ask mentors to name a person they consider successful and write down why they consider him/her successful. It could be anyone from the media or from the family. Identifying habits, traits, achievements & circumstances of the successful people should be encouraged.

Once mentees have listed down the reasons/ indicators of success, start asking mentees if the person would still be successful if one component of success would be taken away (such as taking away house, money, cars one by one). Once you have eliminated all superficial factors, only the real parameters would remain such as education, respect etc.  

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Make mentees evaluate traits and actions of people they assume to be successful.
- Deliver the concept of success/ failure and determine the real success factors
- Enable mentees to come up with their own definition of success

#### Notes
```Mentees will most likely associate success with materialism. Materialism, as generally considered a sign of success, is not bad if it is acquired through legitimate means.
Mentors should nudge the discussion to arrive at a balanced definition of success, narrowing down on character traits.```
