#### Objectives
- Probing menteesâ€™ existing notions of traits of successful and unsuccessful people that they know of and admire/criticize
- Developing a relative but holistic definition of success

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
- Chalk

#### How It Works
Divide mentees into pairs and divide the board into three columns(if you have 6 mentees/3 pairs on avg) Ask each pair to discuss and draw any person they perceive to be successful and wish to be like. In addition to drawing, the mentees must also write down anything that has made their choice of person successful on the board.Mentors are required to play the devil's advocate and plug in cars, guards, houses, money into the perceptions to encourage questioning. Each pair will then explain why they have drawn the person, while the rest of the group will determine if any quality/part of the drawing needs to be amended. For example, the group could collectively decide to edit the cars as cars do not signify success etc

Mentors should then lead the discussion once all 3 figures have been discussed and amended.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Make mentees evaluate traits and actions in the light of personal and collective moral code
- Deliver the concept of success/ failure and determine the real success factors
- Engage the mentees through artwork of people they can relate to
- Enable mentees to come up with their own definition of success

#### Post-Activity Messages
- Each child has a different reality and there can be difference of opinion. Encourage it and expect that there may be multiple possible definitions of success coming up.
- Agree on a SINGLE definition of success and failure as a group.

#### Notes
```Mentees will most likely associate success with materialism. Materialism, as generally considered a sign of success, is not bad if it is acquired through legitimate means.
Mentors should nudge the discussion to arrive at a balanced definition of success, narrowing down on character traits.```
