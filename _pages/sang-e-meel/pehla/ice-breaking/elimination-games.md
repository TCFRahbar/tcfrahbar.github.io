#### Objectives
- Ice breaking
- Warm up

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
Play any of the following traditional elimination games with the kids as a group. The person who gets eliminated introduces themselves and something interesting about them (likes/dislikes, if they were an animal who they would be, etc.)

#### Elimination Games:

- Kho Kho
- Kabaddi
- Barf Paani
- King King

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Warmup and energy boost

#### Post-Activity Messages
Appreciate the mentees for their contribution and agree to keep the energy and participation up.

#### Notes
```As the number of eliminated people from the group increases, as soon as a mentor gets eliminated, he/she joins the eliminated kids' group and strikes up a conversation with them to know more about them and keep them involved in the activity```
