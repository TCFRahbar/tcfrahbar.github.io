#### Objectives
- Fun icebreaking
- Warmup

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
Chairs in a circle, facing outwards

#### How It Works
Arrange chairs in a circle, each chair facing outward. The number of chairs should be one less that the number of mentors plus mentees.

Nominate one of the mentors to be the Conductor.

Proceed to play music together and as a group, revolve around the chairs. Music can be clapping or a song that everyone sings. The Conductor stops the music and everyone proceeds to take a chair each. The person who is left out gets to introduce themselves; their name and something interesting about them (likes/ dislikes, if they had a superpower what it would be etc.).

Take out one chair from the circle and resume the music and revolving.

Repeat until everyone has been introduced.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Warmup and energy boost

#### Post-Activity Messages
Appreciate the mentees for their contribution and agree to keep the energy and participation up.

Variants
Instead of revolving around chairs, you can pass an object (e.g. balloon, a ball) around until the music stops and the person in possession of the object at that moment introduces themselves.
