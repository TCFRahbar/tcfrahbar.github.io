title: Two Truths and A Lie
permalink: /truths-lies/
---


#### Objectives
- Icebreaking
- Group bonding

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
Going around in a circle, each group member introduces themselves and then tells three statements about themselves, two of which have to be true and one has to be a lie. The remaining group listens and then tries to guess which statement was a lie.

It is suggested that the game starts with a mentor rather than a mentee. This way the mentor can demonstrate the activity too and set the pace for it.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Knowing more about each other

##### Post-Activity Messages
Where applicable, the mentors can strike a conversation with the mentees too and share stories regarding the truths they share.

#### Variants
It can also be Two Lies and A Truth that works the same way except two lies have to be told instead of one and the truth must be spotted by the group.

### Notes
```Mentors can prepare "interesting facts" about them beforehand. The tone and humor that mentors set with the kind of truths and lies they tell will automatically be picked up by the kids.```
