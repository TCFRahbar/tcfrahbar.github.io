#### Objectives
- Icebreaking
- Trust and Confidentiality

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
- Paper chits

#### How It Works
Have each person write down on a paper chit a secret about them that no one knows. Ask everyone to fold these chits. Randomly open the chits one by one and read out the written secret. The entire group tries to guess who the secret belongs to and why. Once the person has been identified, ask the person to introduce themselves and a little bit more about the story behind the secret. Everybody claps to welcome the person.

Repeat until all chits have been opened and everyone introduced.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Sharing personal stories and Confidentiality

#### Post-Activity Messages
Appreciate the mentees for their contribution and stress that the stories and secrets told will remain within the group only. Stress on confidentiality for similar future instances.

#### Notes
```To make sure no awkward secrets come out, the mentors can explain that the secret can be about an achievement, something good or courageous done.```
