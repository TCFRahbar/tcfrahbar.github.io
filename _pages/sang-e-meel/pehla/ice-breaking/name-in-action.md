#### Objectives
- Icebreaking
- Warmup

#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
Ask the group to form a circle.

Each participant thinks of an action verb than starts with the first letter of their name (e.g. Flying Farrukh, Aaam khata hua Asad, Sleeping Samina etc.) Each action verb must be accompanied with the corresponding gesture/ movement.

A participant goes to the centre of the circle, says their name along with the action verb (like the examples above) and performs the gesture/ movement with it.

The rest of the group takes two steps towards the centre of the circle and repeats the name along with action verb and the gesture/ movement as well. They then take two steps back to return to original position.

Repeat for each group member.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Warmup and energy boost

#### Post-Activity Messages
Appreciate the mentees for their contribution and agree to keep the energy and participation up.
