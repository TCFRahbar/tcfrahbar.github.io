### Objectives
- Icebreaking
- Getting to know each other better
- Setting a light atmosphere for the rest of the session

#### Pre-activity Requirements
- Circular sitting

#### Materials/ Resrouces
- Yarn ball

#### How It Works
Have the group sit in a circle. Give one person a ball of yarn. Have that person introduce themselves first. Mentors can use the questions below to facilitate the discussion further with that mentee. Then, ask that person to hold on to the end of yarn and throw the rest of the ball to another person in the circle. The person who catches the ball of yarn then does the same.

Some sample questions/variations that mentors can use during the activity are:

- What can they guess about the mentors
- Their Likes and dislikes
- What do they do in their spare time
- Sing a Song/ Tell a Joke
- How many siblings do they have
- Describe their day
- Favorite sports hero
- True/False – make one true and one false statement and the group guesses which one is true and which is not
- One interesting/unique fact about themselves
- Something brave that they did
- A secret about them not many people know

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Mentors should remember the mentees' names by the end of the activity
- Openness and comfort between mentees and mentors

#### Post-Activity Messages
At the end of this activity, as a result of holding onto one end of the yarn and throwing it to someone else over and over, a Web of Yarn would have been constructed between the group. Using this web, the mentors can highlight multiple points:

- We are all connected like this web
- If one of us goes missing or doesn't hold up their end, the web will be no longer (emphasize teamwork and regularity of attendance for Rahbar)

#### Variants
Mentors can alternatively use a tennis ball and use the variations given above while tossing the ball amongst the group.

### Notes
```Please do not discuss mentees’ future plans with them in the first session, leave that for later sessions```
