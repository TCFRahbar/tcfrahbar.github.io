#### Objectives
Mentors and mentees identify and share three good and three bad habits about them, discuss them and how to overcome them
Increased comfort level and sharing within the group
Trust, honesty and confidentiality

#### Pre-activity Requirements
- Icebreaking has been done.

#### Materials/ Resources
- Paper chits

#### How It Works
Have each person write down on separate chits two to three good and two to three bad habits about them. Ask everyone to fold these chits. Put them all in a hat or jar etc. Randomly take out and open the chits one by one and read out the written good or bad habit. The entire group honestly raises their hand if they possess that good or bad habit. Multiple hands may go up. Also, encourage mentees to raise their hand even if it is a habit not written by them but they think they have it.

Then ask the group to share stories about the habit, how they demonstrate it or how it affects them. Once discussed, move on to the next habit. Discard chits that repeat a habit already discussed.

Repeat until all chits have been opened and discussed.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Increased openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- A list of good/bad habits that the mentors know now about their mentees and can address individually throughout the remaining weeks
- Increased understanding of the mentees for the mentors to better communicate their messages

#### Post-Activity Messages
You can drop a hint that next week you will actually be telling the mentees of an amazing method (Soch se Taqdeer) to improve on bad habits and acquire good habits. Ask them to think (soch) about it and it will be followed up next week. Even ask them to write an entry about it in their Rahbar Journal.
