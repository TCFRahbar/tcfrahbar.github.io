#### Objectives
- Mentors and mentees identify and share three good and three bad habits about them, discuss them and how to overcome them
- Increased comfort level and sharing within the group
- Trust, honesty and confidentiality

#### Pre-activity Requirements
- Icebreaking has been done.

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
The mentors "demonstrate" examples of good and bad habits via multiple brief, half-minute roleplays. The mentees observe the roleplays and try to figure out the good or bad habit being communicated. Once the mentors are done demonstrating their habits, they ask the mentees to demonstrate their good and bad habits in a similar manner.

The mentors can participate with the mentees for the roleplays.

Once the good and bad habits have been identified, get together and discuss for a while, stories behind these habits, how they affect your lives and possible strategies for maintaining the good habits and improving or dropping the bad habits.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Increased openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- A list of good/bad habits that the mentors know now about their mentees and can address individually throughout the remaining weeks
- Increased understanding of the mentees for the mentors to better communicate their messages

#### Post-Activity Messages
You can drop a hint that next week you will actually be telling the mentees of an amazing method (Soch se Taqdeer) to improve on bad habits and acquire good habits. Ask them to think (soch) about it and it will be followed up next week. Even ask them to write an entry about it in their Rahbar Journal.

#### Variants
Charades instead of roleplays

#### Notes
To keep an eye on the time, you can have roleplays for one good and one bad habit for each group member and then discuss the remaining two good and bad habits after you return to your seats.
