#### Objectives
The group comes up with their own code of conduct for the remaining weeks of Rahbar

#### Pre-activity Requirements
- Icebreaking has been done.

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
The mentors "demonstrate" examples of good and bad conduct for Rahbar sessions via multiple brief, half-minute or one-minute roleplays. The mentees observe the roleplays and try to figure out the conduct point being communicated. The group lists these conduct points and agrees to stick to them for the remaining sessions.

Some scenarios/ behaviours mentors can act out are:

- Being rude and offensive to each other (Conduct point: be friendly and supportive)
- Arriving late or being absent (Conduct point: punctuality and regularity)
- Cutting each other off (Conduct point: listen to each other)
- Chewing gum or 'chhaalia' etc. (Conduct point: to not do so)

#### Targeted Outcomes
- A code of conduct that reinforces participation, openness and regularity for the program is agreed upon
- Increased openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
- Conduct points are reached with the mentees' participation rather than them being just told about it

#### Post-Activity Messages
The group agrees to stick to the Rahbar kay Usool for the remaining weeks.

#### Variants
After one or two roleplays, the mentors can ask mentees to do similar roleplays and demonstrate conduct points that they feel are required for the remaining weeks.
