#### Objectives
The group comes up with their own code of conduct for the remaining weeks of Rahbar
Activity and discovery. Builds group cohesion

#### Pre-activity Requirements
- Icebreaking has been done.
- Mentors have hidden the paper chits at various places in the classroom or around the school.

#### Materials/ Resources
- Paper chits with code of conduct points written on them
- Clue cards (optional)

#### How It Works
Prepare code of conduct paper chits, with each conduct point written on a separate piece of paper. You can also throw in some funny or unwanted conduct points which can be discussed and laughed at/ discarded later. For instance, some of the conduct points could be:

- Har haftay waqt pe Rahbar aana hai
- Achay bachon ki tarah har haftay diary likh kay laani hai
- Class mein chewing gum khani hai (unwanted)
- Class mein sar kay bal chal kay aana hai (funny)

Hide these paper chits.

Inform the mentees that they are to embark on a treasure hunt. That you have hidden 'gems' to be found at various places in the classroom or around the school and they have to find them.

How would the mentees spot these gems? You can do this in various ways:

- The pieces of paper can be distinct. E.g. a bright color (yellow, orange, pink) easy to spot, or rolled up and tied with a ribbon
- You can use clue cards to suggest to the mentees where these pieces can be found. Clue cards can be puzzles that point to the direction (e.g. Kitaabon kay lashkar mein, i.e. library)
- The front of the piece of paper contains the conduct point and the back has clues to where to find the next piece of paper.
Once all 'gems' have been located, return to the classroom and briefly summarize.

#### Targeted Outcomes
A code of conduct that reinforces participation, openness and regularity for the program is agreed upon
Increased openness and comfort between mentees and mentors
Conduct points are reached with the mentees' participation rather than them being just told about it

#### Post-Activity Messages
Briefly discuss the points with the mentees and as a group come together to sticking to them throughout the remaining weeks. Appreciate the mentees for their contribution and agree to keep the energy and participation up.
