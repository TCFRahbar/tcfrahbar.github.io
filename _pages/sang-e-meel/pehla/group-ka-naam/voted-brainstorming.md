#### Pre-activity Requirements
None

#### Materials/ Resources
None

#### How It Works
Brainstorming works best here. Openly inviting and coming up with options for names first, then related slogans, even logos and handshakes.

The brainstorming process can be made more fun by introducing "voting" to arrive at the chosen option. For instance, mentors invite mentees to come up with possible names of the group and write them down on the greenboard. Now, to select the best option, the entire group is asked to "vote" on each option.

Mentees and mentors can "cast their vote" a little differently, e.g.

- Raising both hands in the air to show total agreement and one hand in the air to show half agreement
- Making a common sound to case a vote. E.g., an animal sound (roar for acceptance, meow for rejection), a funny sound (ka-ching for acceptance, buzzzz for rejection)
After the votes have been cast, either shortlist options and go again, or finalize the name.

Follow up the name selection with similar ways for slogan, logo etc.

#### Targeted Outcomes
- Group identity is decided
- Group logo and slogan are decided

#### Post-Activity Messages
Assign a mentee or a mentor with the responsibility to make ID cards for your group members with the logo, name, slogan and group member name included on the cards and bring them to the next session. Mentees and mentors wear these cards during the sessions for the remaining weeks.
